# snake_game
A snake game I created by following step by step from a javascript course I was doing

You can download my project and run the snake.html file in a browser

Instructions:
Press arrow keys (← → ↑ ↓) to move the snake
Eat food to get bigger and don't hit yourself :P
Click on the canvas below to start/restart the game
